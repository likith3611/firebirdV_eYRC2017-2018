 Concepts covered:  ADC, LCD. SENSOR interfacing

 In this experiment ADC captures data from the analog sensors such as Ultrasonic 
 Range Sensors, Whiteline sensors and Battery voltage and displayed it on the LCD.

 Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect proximity of any obstacles in the very short 
 range to long range from the robot. We are using EZ series of Ultrasonic Range Sensors 
 from Maxbotix. It can sense obsticals from from 6-inches to 254-inches with 1-inch 
 resolution. Output analog voltage has scaling factor of (Vcc/512) per inch. A supply 
 of 5V yields ~9.8mV/inch.

 White line sensors are used for detecting white line on the ground surface. White 
 lines are used to give robot sense of localization. White line sensor consists of 
 IR photo diode for line sensing and IRLED for illumination. White line cause increace 
 in reflected light resulting fall in voltage across the photodiode. 


 There are Three IR Proximity sensor, Three White Line Sensors on the SPARKV robot. 
 There are sockets for four Ultrasonic Range Sensors from Maxbotix. Due to limted 
 number of ADC channels either we can use IR Proximity sensors or Ultrasonic Range Sensors
 by jumper settings of J2,J3,J4 on the Robot. In this expirement three Ultrasonic Range
 Sensors are connected. You can also use less number of Ultrasonic Range Sensors. To do
 that you need to short some pads. For correct jumper setting and pad settings refer 
 to robot's hardware manual.

 
 IR Proximity Sensor interfacing is covered in "7A_ADC_IRWLBAT_Sensor_display_On_LCD"
 experiment.
  
 ADC Connection:
 			  ACD CH.	PORT	Sensor
			  0			PA0		Ultrasonic analog sensor Left
			  1			PA1		Ultrasonic analog sensor Center
			  2			PA2		Ultrasonic analog sensor Right
			  3			PA3		White line sensor Left
			  4			PA4		White line sensor Center
			  5			PA5		White line sensor Right
			  6			PA6		Battery Voltage
			  7         PA7     4th Ultrasonic Range Sensor Analog output is connected from 
			                    external connector (Refer Ultrasonic range sensor interfacing 
								in Manual)

 LCD Connections:
 			  LCD	  Microcontroller Pins
 			  RS  --> PC0
			  RW  --> PC1
			  EN  --> PC2
			  DB7 --> PC7
			  DB6 --> PC6
			  DB5 --> PC5
			  DB4 --> PC4


 Jumper settings:
 There are sockets for four Ultrasonic Range Sensors from Maxbotix. Due to 
 limted number of ADC channels either we can use IR Proximity sensors or 
 Ultrasonic Range Sensors by jumper settings of J2,J3,J4 on the Robot. For 
 correct jumper setting refer to robot's hardware manual.

 Note: 
 
 1. Make sure that in the configuration options following settings are 
 	done for proper operation of the code

 	Microcontroller: atmega16
 	Frequency: 7372800
 	Optimization: -O0 (For more information read section: Selecting proper optimization
	              options below figure 4.22 in the hardware manual)

 2. Make sure that you copy the lcd.c file in your folder
